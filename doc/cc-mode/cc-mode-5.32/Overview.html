<h2 class="chapter">2 Overview of the Manual</h2>

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
<p class="noindent">The manual starts with several introductory chapters (including this
one).

<p class="noindent">The next chunk of the manual describes the day to day <em>use</em> of
CC Mode (as contrasted with how to customize it).

     <ul>
<li>The chapter &ldquo;Commands&rdquo; describes in detail how to use (nearly) all
of CC Mode's features.  There are extensive cross-references from
here to the corresponding sections later in the manual which tell you
how to customize these features.

     <li>&ldquo;Font Locking&rdquo; describes how &ldquo;syntax highlighting&rdquo; is applied to
your buffers.  It is mainly background information and can be skipped
over at a first reading. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The next chunk of the manual describes how to <em>customize</em>
CC Mode.  Typically, an overview of a topic is given at the chapter
level, then the sections and subsections describe the material in
increasing detail.

     <ul>
<li>The chapter &ldquo;Configuration Basics&rdquo; tells you <em>how</em> to write
customizations - whether in hooks, in styles, in both, or in neither,
depending on your needs.  It describes the CC Mode style system and
lists the standard styles that CC Mode supplies.

     <li>The next few chapters describe in detail how to customize the various
features of CC Mode.

     <li>Finally, there is a sample <span class="file">.emacs</span> fragment, which might help you
in creating your own customization. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The manual ends with &ldquo;this and that&rdquo;, things that don't fit cleanly
into any of the previous chunks.

     <ul>
<li>Two chapters discuss the performance of CC Mode and known
bugs/limitations.

     <li>The FAQ contains a list of common problems and questions.

     <li>The next two chapters tell you how to get in touch with the CC Mode
project - whether for updating CC Mode or submitting bug reports. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Finally, there are the customary indices.
