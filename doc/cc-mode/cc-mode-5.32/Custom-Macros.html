<h2 class="chapter">12 Customizing Macros</h2>

<p><a name="index-macros-606"></a><a name="index-preprocessor-directives-607"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

   <p>Preprocessor macros in C, C++, and Objective C (introduced by
<code>#define</code>) have a syntax different from the main language&mdash;for
example, a macro declaration is not terminated by a semicolon, and if
it is more than a line long, line breaks in it must be escaped with
backslashes.  CC Mode has some commands to manipulate these, see
<a href="Macro-Backslashes.html#Macro-Backslashes">Macro Backslashes</a>.

   <p>Normally, the lines in a multi-line macro are indented relative to
each other as though they were code.  You can suppress this behavior
by setting the following user option:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>c-syntactic-indentation-in-macros</b><var><a name="index-c_002dsyntactic_002dindentation_002din_002dmacros-608"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-syntactic_002dindentation_002din_002dmacros-_0028c_002d_0029-609"></a>Enable syntactic analysis inside macros, which is the default.  If this
is <code>nil</code>, all lines inside macro definitions are analyzed as
<code>cpp-macro-cont</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Because a macro can expand into anything at all, near where one is
invoked CC Mode can only indent and fontify code heuristically. 
Sometimes it gets it wrong.  Usually you should try to design your
macros so that they &rdquo;look like ordinary code&rdquo; when you invoke them. 
However, one situation is so common that CC Mode handles it
specially: that is when certain macros needn't (or mustn't) be
followed by a <span class="samp">;</span>.  You need to configure CC Mode to handle
these macros properly, see <a href="Macros-with-_003b.html#Macros-with-_003b">Macros with ;</a>.
