<h2 class="chapter">3 Limitations and Known Bugs</h2>

<p><a name="index-limitations-635"></a><a name="index-bugs-636"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

     <ul>
<li>CC Mode doesn't support trigraphs.  (These are character sequences
such as <span class="samp">??(</span>, which represents <span class="samp">[</span>.  They date from a time
when some character sets didn't have all the characters that C needs,
and are now utterly obsolete.)

     <li>There is no way to apply auto newline settings (see <a href="Auto_002dnewlines.html#Auto_002dnewlines">Auto-newlines</a>)
on already typed lines.  That's only a feature to ease interactive
editing.

     <p>To generalize this issue a bit: CC Mode is not intended to be used as
a reformatter for old code in some more or less batch-like way.  With
the exception of some functions like <code>c-indent-region</code>, it's only
geared to be used interactively to edit new code.  There's currently no
intention to change this goal.

     <!-- WARNING!!!! -->
<!-- If you change the way the following reference to GNU indent gets -->
<!-- compiled into the HTML version of the manual, make sure that -->
<!-- 2www.gnu.org.sh still strips out the broken pointer, amending the -->
<!-- script if necessary. -->
<p>If you want to reformat old code, you're probably better off using some
other tool instead, e.g. GNU indent, which has more powerful reformatting capabilities than
CC Mode.

     <li>The support for C++ templates (in angle brackets) is not yet complete. 
When a non-nested template is used in a declaration, CC Mode indents
it and font-locks it OK.  Templates used in expressions, and nested
templates do not fare so well.  Sometimes a workaround is to refontify
the expression after typing the closing <span class="samp">&gt;</span>.

     <li>In a <dfn>k&amp;r region</dfn> (the part of an old-fashioned C function
declaration which specifies the types of its parameters, coming
between the parameter list and the opening brace), there should be at
most 20 top-level parenthesis and bracket pairs.  This limit has been
imposed for performance reasons.  If it is violated, the source file
might be incorrectly indented or fontified.

     <li>On loading CC Mode, sometimes this error message appears:

     <pre class="example">          File mode specification error: (void-variable c-font-lock-keywords-3)
     </pre>
     <p>This is due to a bug in the function <code>eval-after-load</code> in some
versions of (X)Emacs.  It can manifest itself when there is a symbolic
link in the path of the directory which contains (X)Emacs.  As a
workaround, put the following into your <span class="file">.emacs</span> file, fairly
early on:

     <pre class="example">          (defun my-load-cc-fonts ()
            (require "cc-fonts"))
          (add-hook 'c-initialization-hook 'my-load-cc-fonts)
     </pre>
     </ul>
