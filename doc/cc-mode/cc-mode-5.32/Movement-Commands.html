<h3 class="section">4.3 Movement Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-movement-53"></a><!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->

   <p>CC Mode contains some useful commands for moving around in C code.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-a</kbd> (<code>c-beginning-of-defun</code>)<dt><kbd>C-M-e</kbd> (<code>c-end-of-defun</code>)<dd><a name="index-c_002dbeginning_002dof_002ddefun-54"></a><a name="index-c_002dend_002dof_002ddefun-55"></a><a name="index-c_002ddefun_002dtactic-56"></a><a name="index-defun_002dtactic-_0028c_002d_0029-57"></a>
Move to the beginning or end of the current or next function.  Other
constructs (such as a structs or classes) which have a brace block
also count as &ldquo;functions&rdquo; here.  To move over several functions, you
can give these commands a repeat count.

     <p>The start of a function is at its header.  The end of the function is
after its closing brace, or after the semicolon of a construct (such
as a <code>struct</code>) which doesn't end at the brace.  These two
commands try to leave point at the beginning of a line near the actual
start or end of the function.  This occasionally causes point not to
move at all.

     <p>By default, these commands will recognize functions contained within a
<dfn>declaration scope</dfn> such as a C++ <code>class</code> or <code>namespace</code>
construct, should the point start inside it.  If CC Mode fails to find
function beginnings or ends inside the current declaration scope, it
will search the enclosing scopes.  If you want CC Mode to recognize
functions only at the top level<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, set <code>c-defun-tatic</code> to
<code>t</code>.

     <p>These functions are analogous to the Emacs built-in commands
<code>beginning-of-defun</code> and <code>end-of-defun</code>, except they
eliminate the constraint that the top-level opening brace of the defun
must be in column zero.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Defuns.html#Defuns">Defuns (GNU Emacs Manual)</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-a</kbd> (AWK Mode) (<code>c-awk-beginning-of-defun</code>)<dt><kbd>C-M-e</kbd> (AWK Mode) (<code>c-awk-end-of-defun</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dM_002da-_0028AWK-Mode_0029-58"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002de-_0028AWK-Mode_0029-59"></a><a name="index-c_002dawk_002dbeginning_002dof_002ddefun-60"></a><a name="index-awk_002dbeginning_002dof_002ddefun-_0028c_002d_0029-61"></a><a name="index-c_002dawk_002dend_002dof_002ddefun-62"></a><a name="index-awk_002dend_002dof_002ddefun-_0028c_002d_0029-63"></a>Move to the beginning or end of the current or next AWK defun.  These
commands can take prefix-arguments, their functionality being entirely
equivalent to <code>beginning-of-defun</code> and <code>end-of-defun</code>.

     <p>AWK Mode <dfn>defuns</dfn> are either pattern/action pairs (either of which
might be implicit) or user defined functions.  Having the <span class="samp">{</span> and
<span class="samp">}</span> (if there are any) in column zero, as is suggested for some
modes, is neither necessary nor helpful in AWK mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-a</kbd> (<code>c-beginning-of-statement</code>)<dt><kbd>M-e</kbd> (<code>c-end-of-statement</code>)<dd><a name="index-M_002da-64"></a><a name="index-M_002de-65"></a><a name="index-c_002dbeginning_002dof_002dstatement-66"></a><a name="index-c_002dend_002dof_002dstatement-67"></a><a name="index-beginning_002dof_002dstatement-_0028c_002d_0029-68"></a><a name="index-end_002dof_002dstatement-_0028c_002d_0029-69"></a>Move to the beginning or end of the innermost C statement.  If point
is already there, move to the next beginning or end of a statement,
even if that means moving into a block.  (Use <kbd>C-M-b</kbd> or
<kbd>C-M-f</kbd> to move over a balanced block.)  A prefix argument <var>n</var>
means move over <var>n</var> statements.

     <p>If point is within or next to a comment or a string which spans more
than one line, these commands move by sentences instead of statements.

     <p>When called from a program, these functions take three optional
arguments: the repetition count, a buffer position limit which is the
farthest back to search for the syntactic context, and a flag saying
whether to do sentence motion in or near comments and multiline
strings.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-u</kbd> (<code>c-up-conditional</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002du-70"></a><a name="index-c_002dup_002dconditional-71"></a><a name="index-up_002dconditional-_0028c_002d_0029-72"></a>Move back to the containing preprocessor conditional, leaving the mark
behind.  A prefix argument acts as a repeat count.  With a negative
argument, move forward to the end of the containing preprocessor
conditional.

     <p><span class="samp">#elif</span> is treated like <span class="samp">#else</span> followed by <span class="samp">#if</span>, so the
function stops at them when going backward, but not when going
forward.

     <p>This key sequence is not bound in AWK Mode, which doesn't have
preprocessor statements.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-up-conditional-with-else</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002dup_002dconditional_002dwith_002delse-73"></a><a name="index-up_002dconditional_002dwith_002delse-_0028c_002d_0029-74"></a>A variety of <code>c-up-conditional</code> that also stops at <span class="samp">#else</span>
lines.  Normally those lines are ignored.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-down-conditional</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002ddown_002dconditional-75"></a><a name="index-down_002dconditional-_0028c_002d_0029-76"></a>Move forward into the next nested preprocessor conditional, leaving
the mark behind.  A prefix argument acts as a repeat count.  With a
negative argument, move backward into the previous nested preprocessor
conditional.

     <p><span class="samp">#elif</span> is treated like <span class="samp">#else</span> followed by <span class="samp">#if</span>, so the
function stops at them when going forward, but not when going backward.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-down-conditional-with-else</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002ddown_002dconditional_002dwith_002delse-77"></a><a name="index-down_002dconditional_002dwith_002delse-_0028c_002d_0029-78"></a>A variety of <code>c-down-conditional</code> that also stops at <span class="samp">#else</span>
lines.  Normally those lines are ignored.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-p</kbd> (<code>c-backward-conditional</code>)<dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd> (<code>c-forward-conditional</code>)<dd><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dp-79"></a><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dn-80"></a><a name="index-c_002dbackward_002dconditional-81"></a><a name="index-c_002dforward_002dconditional-82"></a><a name="index-backward_002dconditional-_0028c_002d_0029-83"></a><a name="index-forward_002dconditional-_0028c_002d_0029-84"></a>Move backward or forward across a preprocessor conditional, leaving
the mark behind.  A prefix argument acts as a repeat count.  With a
negative argument, move in the opposite direction.

     <p>These key sequences are not bound in AWK Mode, which doesn't have
preprocessor statements.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x c-backward-into-nomenclature</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x c-forward-into-nomenclature</kbd><dd><a name="index-c_002dbackward_002dinto_002dnomenclature-85"></a><a name="index-c_002dforward_002dinto_002dnomenclature-86"></a><a name="index-backward_002dinto_002dnomenclature-_0028c_002d_0029-87"></a><a name="index-forward_002dinto_002dnomenclature-_0028c_002d_0029-88"></a>A popular programming style, especially for object-oriented languages
such as C++ is to write symbols in a mixed case format, where the
first letter of each word is capitalized, and not separated by
underscores.  E.g. <span class="samp">SymbolsWithMixedCaseAndNoUnderlines</span>.

     <p>These commands move backward or forward to the beginning of the next
capitalized word.  With prefix argument <var>n</var>, move <var>n</var> times. 
If <var>n</var> is negative, move in the opposite direction.

     <p>Note that these two commands have been superseded by
<code>c-subword-mode</code>, which you should use instead.  See <a href="Subword-Movement.html#Subword-Movement">Subword Movement</a>.  They might be removed from a future release of CC Mode.
