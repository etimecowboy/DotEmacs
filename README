* Introduction

This is my Emacs configuration with various collected lisps.

All the files should be placed in "~/.emacs.d/", where "~" means your
HOME. For Windows users, please set an environmental variable for your
account.

* Installation

1. Clone the repository to "~/.emacs.d/" with all submodules.
2. Enter "~/.emacs.d/bin" folder, and then the sub-folder that matches
   the running operating system.
3. Run the "make-my-emacs" script in your Linux terminal or the MinGW
   bash shell in Windows, or just start emacs, then compile emacs lisps
   (C-x B or M-x xy/emacs-build) serveral times if there were errors.

* Reconfiguration

1. Make sure there is no ~/.emacs.d/my-lisps/init/xy-rcroot-env.elc
(normally, it has be deleted by emacs itself)
2. Restart emacs.

* Note

1. Change of default key bindings
   - Close current Emacs frame (C-x C-c or M-x xy/done)
   - Close this Emacs session (C-x M-c or M-x save-buffers-kill-emacs)
