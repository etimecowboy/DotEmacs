* Introduction

This is my Emacs configuration with various collected lisps.

All the files should be placed in "~/.emacs.d/", where "~" means your
HOME. For Windows users, please set an environmental vairable for your
account.

* Installation

1. Clone the repository to "~/.emacs.d/".
2. Enter "~/.emacs.d/bin" folder, and then the sub-folder that matches
   the running operating system.
3. Run the "make-my-emacs" script in your Linux terminal or the MinGW
   bash shell in Windows.
